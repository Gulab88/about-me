    <h2>Data Science Capstone</h2>
    <p>I conducted descriptive analytics on the national inpatient services dataset for fiscal year 2011 provided by the  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. My fields of interest were the 100 disease related groups (DRGs) studied, national discharge totals for each DRG, and national Medicare payout totals for each DRG. I aggregated relevant data from the original dataset, computed summary statistics, and visualized the data using Python and its associated data science packages: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. I conclusively proposed further applications for my analytics specifically targeted at reducing patient discharge totals through preventive health measures, which would also lead to decreased Medicare payout. This is significant due to the projected increase in federal spending on Medicare over the next few years in context of the federal deficit.</p>
